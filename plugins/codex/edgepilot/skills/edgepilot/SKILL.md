# EdgePilot Live router

The Node Ready Bridge always exposes `edgepilot_runtime_status`,
`edgepilot_runtime_start`, `edgepilot_runtime_update` and `edgepilot_runtime_repair`, even
before Runtime exists. The bridge automatically prepares the release-bound Runtime before first business use; never treat an older compatible Runtime as ready. Call status when Host tools are unavailable, then start once. When
Runtime is ready, use the five Host meta tools:

1. `edgepilot_connection_list`
2. `edgepilot_tool_search`
3. `edgepilot_tool_get`
4. `edgepilot_tool_execute`
5. `edgepilot_result_present`

Search for an operation, fetch its exact current descriptor, then execute with the returned
`schema_revision`. Do not invent dynamic MCP tools or cache operation schemas in the
plugin. Strategy package and configuration digests returned by the Runtime must remain
unchanged through backtest or execution requests.

Route one user outcome at a time:

- account availability goes directly to `edgepilot_connection_list`;
- unknown capabilities use one concise English `edgepilot_tool_search` query, with named
  toolkits as filters and no execution values in the query;
- retrieve up to eight exact contracts in one `edgepilot_tool_get` call;
- batch only independent calls in `edgepilot_tool_execute`; a value returned by an earlier
  call starts a later batch;
- use `presentation: "if_required"` normally and present only an execute-minted
  `result_ref`.

For chat recommendation, call the read-only `edgepilot_strategy_recommend` convenience
tool with the user's structured questionnaire; it delegates to
`catalog.strategy.recommend` in the Host. Do not replace recommendation with generic
catalog search. For “open”, “start” or “launch EdgePilot”, ensure Runtime is ready, then
call `edgepilot_dashboard_open`; return its loopback URL and never spawn a legacy Dashboard
directly.

## First-use onboarding

Run this flow only when the user selects a setup/recommendation starter prompt or explicitly
asks for onboarding. Reply in the user's current language (`en`, `ko`, `zh-CN` or `zh-TW`).
Ordinary requests such as opening the Dashboard, checking a run or searching the catalog
must go directly to that outcome and must not force the questionnaire.

1. Call `edgepilot_runtime_status`. If it is `not_installed`, `stopped` or `update_required`, tell the user
   once that the product Runtime will be downloaded or started, then call
   `edgepilot_runtime_start` exactly once. Never repeat start merely because it takes time.
   On an error, report the stable error and stop; offer repair without silently running it.
   If status is `stale_session` or the message is `plugin_session_stale`, do not start,
   update or repair; tell the user to reload the app or start a new task so Codex loads the
   compatible plugin.
2. Only after `state=ready` and `connection_ready=true`, call
   `edgepilot_dashboard_open` once and return its loopback URL. Then call
   `edgepilot_onboarding_open` once with the current locale. When the host renders its MCP
   App, stop and let the user complete all seven choices, review them and request the
   owner-computed recommendation in that one mounted App.
3. If the host cannot render the onboarding App, apply the **one-question turn boundary**
   as the formal fallback. The internal field order is `profit_style`,
   `holding_period`, `pain_point`, `max_drawdown_pct`, `trading_mode`, `allocation_band`,
   `universe`. Ask only the first unanswered field, with only that field's choices, and end
   the assistant turn immediately. Never display the complete questionnaire, a numbered
   checklist, future questions, future choices or a request for multiple answers. Do not
   even preview what comes next.
4. On the user's next message, retain every valid supplied answer and ask only the next
   unanswered field, then end the turn immediately again. If the current answer is invalid
   or ambiguous, clarify only the same field and end the turn; do not advance or expose any
   later field. A message that already contains valid answers may fill them silently, but
   the response still asks at most one unanswered field.
5. After the last answer, use a separate assistant turn to summarize the selected values
   and ask only for explicit confirmation. Do not combine that confirmation request with
   another question and do not call recommendation before confirmation.
6. In the textual fallback, call `edgepilot_strategy_recommend` once with `questionnaire_version="2.0"`, the seven
   confirmed values and the matching locale. Present exactly the three owner-ranked choices:
   best fit, relatively steadier and more aggressive, preserving versions, evidence,
   trade-offs and warnings.

Onboarding never installs a recommended strategy without selection and never starts paper,
demo or live execution. Authentication remains Dashboard-only and every existing live
confirmation gate remains unchanged.

For strategy work, prefer the Runtime workflow hints. The normal dependency order is
catalog search/recommend, exact inspect, install, configuration resolve, backtest start,
durable job status and result get. Keep the selected slug/version and all returned digests
unchanged. Login is Dashboard-only: ask the user to open the Live Dashboard. Never start
Device Authorization or put credentials, access tokens or refresh tokens in chat.

Paper is locally simulated execution. Demo can place orders in an exchange test account.
Both use their explicit `paper.run.*` or `demo.run.*` operations and never imply Live.

Live execution is always two-stage. `live.run.prepare` freezes account, strategy,
configuration, Runtime and risk identity. `live.run.start` requires the attended
confirmation bound to that prepared intent. Never turn a generic “yes” into authorization,
never retry an unknown external effect automatically, and never place credentials in model
arguments or prose.

After an attended result is presented, stop and wait for the App. App submit invokes the
stored exact Owner call once; do not replay the original Execute as confirmation. Continue
only from a later status/result read.

The local MCP route and bearer are created in an owner-private staged copy by the Runtime
Host. If the connection is unavailable, report that the Runtime/Host must be started
or repaired; do not search for Python, install packages, scan ports or call Marketplace MCP
as an internal substitute.
